# aritificial_random_signaling_network
This package was run using the language of Julia 1.2.0 on Windows. The author use Atom IDE, which is not necessary. Download all the files into one folder and run the main script ‘Ground_truth_generation.jl’, and a random signaling network will be generated in an SBML file called ‘sampleNetwork.xml’. There are some parameters modifiable in the ‘Ground_truth_generation.jl’.The number of species (nSpeces) and maximum number of reactions (nRxns_limitation) can be set in code. In addition, the randomly assigned ranges for species concentrations and rate constants can be modified via ‘rnd_species’ and ‘rnd_parameter’. ‘concentration_perturb = 2’ means doubling the concentration at the input species, which is controllable too. This is an important variable to examine whether perturbing the concentration at the input species could change the concentration at the output species. The number of random networks to generate can be set by changing the variable ‘sampleSize’. The file roadrunner_c_api.dll is the dynamic library libRoadRunner. Ground_truth_generation.jl refers to https://github.com/Lukez-pi/NetworkGenerator.jl, and rr_funcs-Jin.jl refers to https://github.com/SunnyXu/RoadRunner.jl/tree/master/src.
