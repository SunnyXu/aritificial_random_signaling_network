# aritificial_random_signaling_network
This package was implemented in Julia 1.2.0 on Windows 10. To use the package, install Julia and download all the files from Github into one folder. Open the APP Julia 1.2.0, and type “include("path/to/Ground_truth_generation.jl")” after the “julia>” sign to run the main script ‘Ground_truth_generation.jl’, and a random signaling network will be generated in SBML [19] format called ‘sampleNetwork.xml’. There are some parameters modifiable in the ‘Ground_truth_generation.jl’. ’The number of species (nSpeces) and maximum number of reactions (nRxns_limitation) can be set in code. In addition, the randomly assigned ranges for species concentrations and rate constants can be modified via ‘rnd_species’ and ‘rnd_parameter’. ‘concentration_perturb = 2’ means doubling the concentration at the input species, which is controllable too. This is an important variable to examine whether perturbing the concentration at the input species could change the concentration at the output species. The number of random networks to generate can be set by changing the variable ‘sampleSize’. The file roadrunner_c_api.dll is the dynamic library for libRoadRunner [17].  Ground_truth_generation.jl refers to https://github.com/Lukez-pi/NetworkGenerator.jl, and rr_funcs-Jin.jl refers to https://github.com/SunnyXu/RoadRunner.jl/tree/master/src.
